# AAMVA DL/ID Barcode Library

### Version: v0.5-beta

*The American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators* (AAMVA) releases a standards guide for driver license and identification card design. The *[2020 AAMVA DL/ID Card Design Standard](https://www.aamva.org/topics/driver-license-and-identification-standards)* outlines the specifications for the Mandatory PDF417 Bar Code in Annex D. Nearly all jurisdictions across North America use this standard for their driver license and identification cards.

This library isn't intended to "scan" these barcodes, but rather parse the data file coming from a barcode scanning tool (like [zxing-cpp](https://pypi.org/project/zxing-cpp/) or [pdf417decoder](https://pypi.org/project/pdf417decoder/)). After it has been parsed and the data elements decoded into human readable properties, the card profile can be displayed to a user or used by other applications.

## Quick Start Example

```python
>>> from aamva.barcode import parse_barcode_string

>>> barcode_string = "@\n\x1e\rANSI 636000100102DL00410278ZV03190008DLDAQT64235789\nDCSSAMPLE\nDDEN\nDACMICHAEL\nDDFN\nDADJOHN\nDDGN\nDCUJR\nDCAD\nDCBK\nDCDPH\nDBD06062019\nDBB06061986\nDBA12102024\nDBC1\nDAU068 in\nDAYBRO\nDAG2300 WEST BROAD STREET\nDAIRICHMOND\nDAJVA\nDAK232690000  \nDCF2424244747474786102204\nDCGUSA\nDCK123456789\nDDAF\nDDB06062018\nDDC06062020\nDDD1\rZVZVA01\r"
# Example output string from PDF417 barcode scanning tool

>>> barcode_file = parse_barcode_string(barcode_string)
# Parse the barcode string to extract the subfiles and elements

>>> barcode_file
# BarcodeFile(header=FileHeader(issuer_id=636000, aamva_version=10, number_of_entries=2, jurisdiction_version=1), subfiles=(Subfile(subfile_type='DL', elements={'DAQ': 'T64235789', 'DCS': 'SAMPLE', 'DDE': 'N', 'DAC': 'MICHAEL', 'DDF': 'N', 'DAD': 'JOHN', 'DDG': 'N', 'DCU': 'JR', 'DCA': 'D', 'DCB': 'K', 'DCD': 'PH', 'DBD': '06062019', 'DBB': '06061986', 'DBA': '12102024', 'DBC': '1', 'DAU': '068 in', 'DAY': 'BRO', 'DAG': '2300 WEST BROAD STREET', 'DAI': 'RICHMOND', 'DAJ': 'VA', 'DAK': '232690000  ', 'DCF': '2424244747474786102204', 'DCG': 'USA', 'DCK': '123456789', 'DDA': 'F', 'DDB': '06062018', 'DDC': '06062020', 'DDD': '1'}), Subfile(subfile_type='ZV', elements={'ZVA': '01'})))
```

Currently in `v0.5-beta` the we can take the barcode file string (captured from a barcode scanning tool) and break it down into it's various parts. These parts are the file header, subfiles, and subfile elements.

The subfile elements is where the profile is stored. This is information like first name, last name, birthday, etc. Profile propertie names like `customer_family_name` are too large for the limited space of the barcode so all property names have been encoded with a three letter name, like `DCS`. This is a form of compression the barcode file uses.

In addition to encoding property names, many properties have different encoding methods for their values. For example gender is represented by an int. 1 = male, 2 = female, 9 = not specified.

The next step in the development process is to decode each of the subfile element into human readable propeties.
